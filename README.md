# OITGThemerFallback
Welcome to OITGThemerFallback.
The purpose of this Framework is to provide a better experience in porting old 3.9 themes to OpenITG. It is definetly recommended that you don't change anything on this code, but to add it on your own theme's metrics and to modify it there, otherwise, the changes won't apply that much to another theme that will use the same Framework; and even worse, it could mess up a lot.

If you really need to modify this file a lot for your own theme, then please package it on your theme but with a different Fallback name, to avoid confusion and breaking if you're planning to re-obtaining the regular OITGThemerFallback.
